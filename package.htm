            <p>
                After your Managing Editor accepts your paper (and before it is sent to final production) your paper will go through reproducibility checks. Therefore, when you submit all your materials for production, you are requested to submit, via Editorial Express, your final files for production, your online appendices, and your replication package. It is important that you carefully follow the instructions below to ensure that your paper and your replication package are not mishandled. This page provides you with detailed information that will help you preparing your replication package. Read it carefully before you submit!
                
            </p>
            
            <h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>
            
            <p>
                You are <b>requested</b> to submit a single zip file with the following <b>folder structure</b> (please name your folders this way!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&quot;1 Paper&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;2 Appendices&quot;</li>
                <li>&quot;3 Replication package&quot;</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
                For folders 1 and 2, please refer to the Econometrics Journal's <a href="https://www.res.org.uk/journals/the-econometrics-journal/submissions.html">Submission Guidelines</a> and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ectj/pages/General_Instructions">General Instructions to Authors</a> and carefully follow the instructions indicated there. In the lines below, you will find specific guidelines about folder 3. If you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), and you are providing the replication team with temporary access to your data, you should send it to us <b>outside of the main zip file</b>. 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Along with your package, but outside of the main zip file, you are requested to submit the following <b><a href="Documents/Checklist_for_authors.pdf">checklist</a></b> completely filled and signed.
            </p>

                As indicated in the journal's <a href="https://www.res.org.uk/journals/the-econometrics-journal/submissions/replication-policy.html">Data and Code Availability Policy</a> all packages should include the following information:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>ReadMe file</b> in PDF format (ReadMe.pdf). We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template</a>. You may find in this web <a href="https://www.templatereadme.org/">app</a> a convenient tool to create your ReadMe file.</li>
                <li>The <b>raw datasets</b> used in the paper and online appendices, including a complete, transparent and precise documentation describing all variables. You can additionally provide the analysis data if this is helpful, but they are not required if the raw data are provided. If you were granted a data exemption at the time of first submission (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), you should either provide the replication team with <b>temporary access</b> to the data for the sole purpose of performing the reproducibility checks, or you should submit a <b>synthetic/simulated</b> dataset that allows running the code and produce all outputs in the paper and appendices, even if the results do not match those in the paper.</li>
                <li>The data <b>cleaning codes</b> and the <b>analysis codes</b> that produce all reproducible outputs reported in the article, appendix, and online appendices (including figures, tables, and numbers reported in the text). In case of simulation/Monte Carlo studies, the authors are requested to set a seed so that the exact numbers that are reported can be obtained. Ideally, but not necessarily, it should include a makefile, so that all results can be replicated from the provided data and code using the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html">make</a> utility.</li>
                <li>If data are provided in proprietary format (e.g. Stata's .dta), a <b>copy of the data in non-proprietary format</b> (e.g. ASCII, csv).</li>
			</ul>

            <h2 id="readme">ReadMe file</h2>
            
            <p>
                The ReadMe file should provide enough instructions so that all users (level of an advanced PhD student and above) can reproduce all the results in the paper in a reasonable amount of time and without problems. We strongly recommend using the following <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template</a>.  You may find in this web <a href="https://www.templatereadme.org/">app</a> a convenient tool to create your ReadMe file. The minimum required information includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Description</b> of the content of the package (datasets, programs, folders, etc.)</li>
                <li><b>Data Availability Statement</b>: precise indications on how the data were obtained, including required registrations, memberships, application procedures, monetary cost, or other qualifications, and, if applicable, URL to download them (which is typically part of the data citation).</li>
                <li>Precise <b>instructions</b> on how to run the code.</li>
                <li>Indications on <b>where to find each output</b> saved/displayed in the package's output.</li>
                <li><b>Software requirements</b>, including the software version and operating system used by the authors.</li>
                <li>All <b>packages and libraries</b> that need to be installed to run the code and a clear indication on how to obtain them.</li>
                <li>Expected <b>running time</b> (even if it is a few seconds). When relevant, include the hardware that the estimated time refers to.</li>
                <li><b>Data citations</b>: all datasets used in the paper (with no exceptions) should be listed in the references section of the <b>paper</b> in the same way that we cite other papers, and a copy of these citations should appear in a dedicated section of the <b>ReadMe</b> file. More specific guidance on data citations is available <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                All datasets used in the paper (with no exceptions) should be listed in the references section of the <b>paper</b> in the same way that we cite other papers, and a copy of these citations should appear in a dedicated section of the <b>ReadMe</b> file. You can find some examples in <a href="Documents/Data_citations.pdf">this document</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the data used in the study is part of the replication package of another paper, both the paper and the replication package should be cited. Even commonly used datasets should be cited (in fact, funding of public and private institutions that make datasets available, even the most widely used ones, crucially depends on data citations!).

            <h2 id="best-practices">Best practices</h2>
            
            <p>
                There is a set of practices that are strongly recommended for all replication packages. The following list includes some of them (acknowledgedly, you are probably seeing some of them too late in the production process, but we strongly encourage you to take a good note for your future research!):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Always keep your raw data intact (i.e. read-only). Generate separate analysis datasets to perform analysis.</li>
                <li>Generate your analysis data using programs, many journals require you to submit them.</li>
                <li>Datasets change over time, keep a record of the date and versions you obtained. It might be difficult to obtain it in the future.</li>
                <li>Separate code and data in your directory structure. This will facilitate (i) keeping versions of your code, and (ii) producing a replication package.</li>
                <li>Use programs/scripts as opposed to command-line instructions!</li>
                <li>Design your code to be run all at once, and not section by section. Create a master file that call all other subsidiary files.</li>
                <li>Use log-files. Make sure that the code stores the output as opposed to only showing it on the screen during runtime.</li>
                <li>Make your code produce all tables and figures as they appear in the manuscript: you will save a lot of time!</li>
                <li>Set the paths only once and at the top of the master-file, and then use either relative paths or global variables, so that users don't have to change the paths in multiple parts of your code.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible, write paths in a way that is compatible across different operating systems. For example, in Stata, always use forward slashes &quot;/&quot; to separate directories, even if you use Windows.</li>
                <li>Run your codes from the replication folder before you submit and make sure it runs and all your results are reproduced.</li>
                <li>If you are using not pre-compiled software (e.g. Fortran, C, etc.), use make files (or else make sure you provide very detailed instructions on how to compile the different files).</li>
                <li>Name your files in a wise manner. For example, if your output generates tables and figures as new files, give them names that easily identify them. Also, name your master file as &quot;Main&quot;, &quot;Master&quot; or something similar.</li>
                <li>Use sub-folders when your package includes a lot of files. Make sure that your package includes all relevant folders, even empty folders that will be filled with the outputs from the program.</li>
            </ul>

                The Data Editors of the American Economic Association (<a href="https://www.vilhuber.com/lars/">Lars Vilhuber</a>) the Review of Economic Studies (<a href="https://koren.mk/">Mikl&oacute;s Koren</a>), the Canadian Journal of Economics (<a href="http://www.connolly.uqam.ca/index_en.html">Marie Connolly</a>), and the Economic Journal and Econometrics Journal (<a href="https://joanllull.github.io/">Joan Llull</a>) are coordinating reproduciblity requirements and guidelines across different journals. An example of this cooperation is this <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/">common guidance by Social Science Data Editors</a>.

            <h2 id="submit">Submit your package</h2>
            
            <p>
                Submit your final files and replication package via <b><a href="https://editorialexpress.com/ectj">Editorial Express</a></b>. If size permits, submit all files into one zip file. If necessary, you can split your zip file into multiple smaller size files (for example using <a href="https://kb.winzip.com/help/winzip/help_splitdlg.htm">this</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                If, even <a href="https://kb.winzip.com/help/winzip/help_splitdlg.htm">splitting zip files</a>, the files are still too large for the Editorial Express platform, please arrange an alternative transfer method with the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ectjdataeditor@gmail.com">ectjdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you were granted a data exemption <b>at the time of first submission</b> (see <a href="before.htm#exemptions">here</a>,  <a href="FAQs.htm#exemptions">here</a>, and <a href="FAQs.htm#exemption-granted">here</a> for details), and you are allowed to provide the Data Editor and the replication team with temporary access to your restricted data for the sole purpose of the reproducibility checks, you should include the confidential data <b>in a separate zip file</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                 The content of this additional zip file will be destroyed after the reproducibility checks are completed. All replicators and the Data Editor have signed confidentiality agreements that protect your submission.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you can provide temporary access but not by sharing the data with the Data Editor (e.g., you can provide a member of the replication team with acccess to a remote server),  please contact the Data Editor at <a href="mailto:ectjdataeditor@gmail.com">ectjdataeditor&#64;gmail.com</a> to arrange the details of the alternative access method. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A few days after you submitted the package you will be contacted by the Data Editor with the outcome of the reproducibility checks, regardless of whether the checks were successful or there are modifications to be made. <b>Please add ectjdataeditor&#64;gmail.com to your safe contacts</b> to avoid that the Data Editor's messages go to spam!
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to implement modifications of your package, you will be instructed to do so in the Data Editor's response. You will iterate with the Data Editor until the reproducibility checks are satisfactory concluded. In subsequent iterations, you will be requested to include a cover letter addressed to the Data Editor explaining how you addressed the different issues raised in the previous iteration. You should submit this separate <b>cover letter outside of the main zip file</b>.
